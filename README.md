Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides
the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of
devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of
building Web pages and Web Applications.

## Study Tips

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass
    tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is
  a very effective way to learn programming.
- Write lots of comments in the examples and exercises. The code in this
  repository is yours to study, modify and re-use in projects.
- Practice

### Study Board

Creating a project board on your GitHub account for tracking your study at HYF
can help you keep track of everything you're learning. You can create the board
at this link: `https://github.com/your_user_name?tab=projects`.

These 4 columns may be helpful:

- **todo**: material you have not studied yet
- **studying**: material you are currently studying
- **to review**: material you want to review again in the future
- **learned**: material you know well enough that you could help your classmates
  learn it

## Code Quality Scripts

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

This repository comes with some scripts to check the quality of this code. You
can run these scripts to check the code provided by HYF, and to check the code
you write when experiment with the examples and complete the exercises.

### `npm run format`

This script will format all of the code in this repository making sure that all
the indentations are correct, the code is easy to read, and letting you know if
there are any syntax errors.

### `npm run format:check`

Checks the formatting of all files in the repository and throws an error if any
files are not well-formatted.

### `npm run spell-check`

This script will check all of the files in your repository for spelling
mistakes. Spelling is not just a detail, is important! Good spelling helps
others read and understand your programs with less effort.

`spell-check` is not so clever though, it doesn't have _all_ possible words in
it's dictionary and it won't know if you _wanted_ to spell a word incorrectly.
If you think one of it's "Unknown word"s is not a problem, you can either ignore
the suggestion or add the word to the `"words": [ ... ],` list in
[.cspell.json](./.cspell.json).

### `npm run lint:md`

This script will [lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) all
the Markdown files in this repository, checking for syntax mistakes and other
bad practices. Fixing linting errors will help you learn to write better code by
pointing out your mistakes _before_ they cause problems in your program.

Some linting errors will take some practice to understand and fix, but it will
be a good use of time.

### `npm run lint:ls` & `npm run lint:css`

This script will [lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) the
names of all files and folders in the project to check that they follow the
project naming convention
([kebab-case](https://betterprogramming.pub/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841)).

### `npm run validate:html`

This script will
[validate](https://webplatform.github.io/docs/guides/html_validation/) the HTML
in this repsitory using
[html-validate](https://gitlab.com/html-validate/html-validate).
