## Steps

1. set up the `repo`

   - use this
     [template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/template-html-css) to
     create a new repo on your gitHub account.
   - turn on `Discussions`.
   - turn on `gitHub` pages.
   - protect `main/master` branch.

2. project definition
   - what is your project about?
   - should be added at the main `README.md`
3. constrains
   - restriction that defines a project's limitations.
   - can be internal or external.
4. communication plan
   - how you will stay in touch?
5. user personas
   - user personas are semi-fictional characters that represent different areas
     of your target audience, user base or stakeholder group.
   - [semrush](https://www.semrush.com/persona/new/)
6. backlog
   - collections of user stories.
   - must have
   - should have
   - could have
7. design( wireframe)
   - a wireframe is a simplified drawing of what your website will look like.
   - [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
8. development strategy
   - translating your `must have` user stories to coding tasks.
   - You can do `should have` and `could have` after finishing all `must have`
     stories(if you have time).
9. development
   - start working on `coding tasks` according to your `development strategy`
10. retrospective
    - a retrospective is meant for looking back at how the project went and
      learning what to do differently next time. An incomplete project with a
      great retrospective is still a success.
